# Resume Filter

A simple web application to filter and display resumes based on user-selected criteria, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The Resume Filter project allows users to filter resumes by different criteria such as skills, experience, or job title. This project is built using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to demonstrate dynamic content filtering on the client side.

## Features

- **Filter by Skills:** Users can filter resumes based on specific skills mentioned in the resumes.
- **Filter by Job Title:** Users can select a job title to view resumes that match that title.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Filtering is done in real-time, with no need for page reloads.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the filtering functionality.
- **(Optional)** Any JavaScript libraries (if you used any, like jQuery).

### Open in a Browser

Once you've cloned the repository, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the application.

## How It Works

1. **HTML:** Defines the structure of the resume filter interface, including the form inputs for filtering and the display area for the resumes.
2. **CSS:** Provides the styling for the page, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. The layout is responsive to ensure it works on various screen sizes.
3. **JavaScript:** Adds functionality to the filter system. When the user selects a filter option (e.g., a specific skill or job title), the JavaScript dynamically updates the list of resumes that match the selected criteria.

### Example Code Snippet

#### HTML: Resume Data Structure

```html
<div class="resume-card" data-skills="HTML,CSS,JavaScript" data-job="Frontend Developer">
  <h3>John Doe</h3>
  <p>Job Title: Frontend Developer</p>
  <p>Skills: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
</div>
```

#### JavaScript: Filter Functionality

```javascript
function filterResumes() {
    let selectedSkill = document.getElementById('skillFilter').value;
    let selectedJob = document.getElementById('jobFilter').value;
    
    let resumes = document.querySelectorAll('.resume-card');
    resumes.forEach(resume => {
        let skills = resume.getAttribute('data-skills').split(',');
        let job = resume.getAttribute('data-job');
        
        if ((selectedSkill === 'All' || skills.includes(selectedSkill)) && 
            (selectedJob === 'All' || job === selectedJob)) {
            resume.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            resume.style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
}
```

### Filtering Options
